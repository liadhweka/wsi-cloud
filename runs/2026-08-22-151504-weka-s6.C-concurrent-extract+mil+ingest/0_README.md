**Filesystem:** weka (mounted at /mnt/weka)
**Stage:** 6.C  ·  **Started (UTC):** 2026-08-22T15:15:07Z

## What was tested

Exact command:

```
scripts/orchestrate-concurrent-stage6c.sh --workloads extract\,mil\,ingest --ramp 300 --runtime 1500 --run-dir /home/ec2-user/wsi-cloud/runs/2026-08-22-151504-weka-s6.C-concurrent-extract+mil+ingest 
```

## Why this run exists

Stage 6.C concurrent multi-workload cell on fs=weka: workloads={extract,mil,ingest} ramp=300s steady=1500s — surgical re-run under the fixed ingest (wiped target) and the declared read-under-write exemption. Retention vs same-leg solo baselines; regime na-mixed-concurrent-workloads.

## What's in this directory

- `metadata.json` — structured metadata (programmatic).
- `cmd.txt` / `cmd.log` — exact command and tee'd stdout+stderr from the benchmark.
- `pre/` — cluster + host state snapshot before the run.
- `raw/` — during-run time series at 1-second resolution. The recorder set is
  per-filesystem (`docs/RUNBOOK.md` holds each leg's Primary-vs-Diagnostic
  table). On this leg:
  - `weka-stats.csv` — per-process cluster stats, 1 Hz poll (filter `Mode==client` for this client).
  - `nvidia-smi.csv` — per-GPU per-second.
  - `sar-{cpu,disk,net,mem,swap,paging,queue,ctxsw}.csv` — host-side categories.
  - `netdev-counters.csv` — kernel NIC counters (Diagnostic here — DPDK bypasses
    the kernel — except on 1.7, where the S3 source traffic makes them Primary).
  - `rdma-counters.csv` — RDMA/EFA device counters; header-only where no such device exists.
  - `nvidia-fs-stats.log` — verbatim 1 Hz nvidia-fs accounting (cuFile path proof, D8).
- `post/` — same snapshot taken after the run, for delta computation.
- `results.json` — parsed aggregates. Re-runnable any time via `scripts/parse-results.py <this-dir>`.

## Project context

This run is part of the WEKA-vs-Lustre WSI storage comparison on AWS.
- `CLAUDE.md` — project rules (docs citation, memory hygiene, recording philosophy).
- `/home/ec2-user/wsi-cloud/docs/STAGES.md` — the `--stage` code map, the per-leg plan, and the cross-stage decision register.
- `/home/ec2-user/wsi-cloud/docs/RUNBOOK.md` — operational runbook (how to run, how to re-parse, how to recover from failures).
